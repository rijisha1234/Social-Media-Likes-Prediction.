# Social-Media-Likes-Prediction.
A Python project for analyzing social media data with random data generation, visualization, and basic statistical analysis
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames, which make it easy to work with structured data.
numpy: Useful for numerical operations. Here, it generates random numbers, which weâ€™ll use to create fake data.
matplotlib.pyplot: Used to create visualizations like histograms and box plots. pyplot is a sub-module in matplotlib that makes plotting easier.
seaborn: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib, which provides high-level plotting functions that make it easy to create visually appealing plots.
random: Provides functions for generating random values. We'll use it to randomly select categories for each social media post.


This project is a Python-based analysis of social media data, featuring:
- Random data generation
- Data cleaning
- Visualizations (histogram, boxplot)
- Basic statistics on engagement (like averages by category)
